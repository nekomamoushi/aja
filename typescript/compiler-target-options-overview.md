# Compiler target option overview

## How to pick a good target

We have to pick an ECMAScript version that works for our target platforms. There are two tables that provide good overviews:

- For browsers: [compat-table.github.io](https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/)
- For Node.js: [node.green](https://node.green/)

We can also check out the [official tsconfig bases](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases) which all provide values for target.
